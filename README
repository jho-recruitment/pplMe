pplMe
=====

Hello, and welcome to pplMe, a small client/server application that is capable
of finding people like you.


BUILDING
--------

pplMe should build on any platform that has gcc 4.7 and GNU make installed.
Change to the pplMe directory and execute the following two commands:
   make 3rdParty
   make
You should now be able to run pplmed, the pplMe server/daemon (located in
src/pplmed) and pplmec, the pplMe command-line client (located in src/pplmec).
Each of these applications can supply usage information via the --help option.

If you would like to run the pplMe test suite, simply execute:
   make test
And for documentation, execute:
   make doco 
(Please note that you will need to have Doxygen and Graphviz in your path for
 the documentation to be generated correctly.)


TESTDATA
--------

pplmed is capable of generating randomized test data by means of the
--test_database_size option; however, this data is reasonably random, and thus
routinely condemns a large proportion of its population to watery graves. 
For a more appropriate dataset, you may want to consider generating some data
based on information from the CIA World Factbook, amongst other things.
To do this simply execute:
   make ppl
(Please note that this target requires a fairly recent version of Python 2.)
You should now be able to fire up pplmed using the following:
   src/pplmed/pplmed --ppldata pplMe-data.csv --alsologtostderr
And in tandem, you should be able to get some v.exciting results with the query:
   src/pplmec/pplmec --latitude 60 --longitude -95 --age 30 --alsologtostderr

The Makefile-based execution of generating data has a hardcoded limit of
one million people as generating Person records is fairly time-consuming.
It is entirely possible to generate more records, but you will need to execute
the Python script directly; simply do something akin to the following:
   python generate_pplme_dataset.py 100000000 > pplMe-data.csv
You probably want to go away now and make a cup of tea.  It's not quick.


CODA
----

Well, that's pretty much it.  Have fun finding ppl!  &:D
If you have any problems or questions, please feel free to contact me.
