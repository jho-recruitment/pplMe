pplMe
=====

Hello, and welcome to pplMe, a small client/server application that is capable
of finding people like you.


BUILDING
--------

pplMe should build on any platform that has gcc 4.7 and GNU make installed.
Change to the pplMe directory and execute the following:
   make 3rdParty
   make
You should now able to run pplmed (in src/pplmed) and pplmec (in src/pplmec).
Both of these applications supply usage information via the --help option.
If you would like to run the tests, simply execute:
   make test
And for documentation, execute:
   make doco 
(Please note that you will need to have Doxygen and Graphviz in your path for
 the documentation to be generated correctly.)


TESTDATA
--------

pplmed is capable of generating randomized test data by means of the
--test_database_size; however, this data is completely randomized, and
presumably routinely condems a large proportion of its population to watery
graves.  For a more appropriate dataset, you may want to consider generating
some data based on information from the CIA World Factbook, amongst other
things.  To do this simply execute (this target requires a fairly recent
version of Python 2):
   make ppl
You can now fire up pplmed using the following:
   src/pplmed/pplmed --ppldata pplMe-data.csv --alsologtostderr
And in addition, you should be able to get some results with the query:
   src/pplmec/pplmec --latitude 60 --longitude -95 --age 30 --alsologtostderr

The Makefile-based execution of generating data has a hardcoded limit of
one million people as generating Person records is fairly time-consuming.
It is entirely possible to generate more records, but you will need to execute
the Python script directly; simply do something akin to the following:
   python generate_pplme_dataset.py 100000000 > pplMe-data.csv
You probably want to go away now and make a cup of tea.  It's not quick.


CODA
----

Well, that's pretty much it.  Have fun finding ppl!  &:D
If you have any problems or questions, please feel free to contact me.
